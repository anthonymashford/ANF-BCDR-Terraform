# ANF-BCDR-Terraform
This repo has examples of deploying Azure NetApp Files service features such as, Snapshots, Snapshot Policy, Backup Vault, Backup Policy and Cross Zone Replication. Features that can all be employed to assist in meeting Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery requirements.

The code here will build a **Resource Group**, **VNet**, **Subnets**, **ANF Account**, **Capacity Pool** and **Volumes**. It will also create a **Backup Vault**, **Backup Policy**, **Snapshot Policy** and configure two volumes with **Replication** source and destination.
